    <!-- Scenario: You are developing a website for a client who requires broad cross-browser compatibility, including older versions of Internet Explorer (IE). The website utilizes modern CSS features and responsive design techniques. Your task is to ensure that the website looks and functions consistently across a wide range of browsers.
    Question: Describe the strategies and techniques you would employ to ensure cross-browser compatibility for the website. Include specific CSS considerations and any tools or resources you would use to test and fix issues in older browsers like IE.
    
    These challenging scenarios require a deep understanding of CSS, responsive design principles, and cross-browser compatibility, making them suitable for more advanced CSS developers. -->
