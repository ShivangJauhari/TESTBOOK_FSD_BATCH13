    <h1>Sardar Patel</h1>
    <p align="center"><b>1875-1950</b></p>
    <h2>Iron Man of India</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel </b>was one of the most influential leaders in the Indian independence movement and a key figure in shaping the modern Indian nation. Born on <b>October 31, 1875</b>, in <b>Nadiad, Gujarat,</b> he earned the title <b>"Sardar,"</b> meaning leader or chief, due to his leadership qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Patel was a staunch supporter of <b> Mahatma Gandhi's principles</b> of non-violence and civil disobedience. He played a crucial role in organizing various movements and protests against British rule, including the famous <b>Salt Satyagraha in 1930.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        One of Patel's most significant contributions was his role in the integration of princely states into the Indian Union after independence in 1947. He worked tirelessly to persuade the rulers of these states to accede to India, using a mix of diplomacy, negotiations, and, when necessary, firmness. This effort prevented the balkanization of India and laid the foundation for its unity and integrity.
    </p>
    <p>        
        For his efforts, Patel is often referred to as the <b> "Iron Man of India"</b> or the <b>"Architect of Modern India."</b> He served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of independent India under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. However, his life was cut short when he passed away on <b>December 15, 1950,</b> leaving behind a legacy of <b>unity, leadership, and nation-building.</b>
