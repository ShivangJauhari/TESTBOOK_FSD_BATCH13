Tata Play Shareholding: Salt to software conglomerate Tata Sons has increased its shareholding in the group’s media and entertainment industry company, Tata Play. The conglomerate has raised its shareholding by purchase of shares.

Tata Sons has raised its shareholding and the conglomerate now owns 70 per cent stake in Tata Play. A report by the Economic Times has mentioned that the increase in shareholding was done by acquiring Singaporean government-owned investment firm Temasek's stake in Tata Play. The company held a 10 per cent stake in Tata Play, which was bought for nearly $100 million (close to Rs 835 crore), according to the report. Tata Group’s DTH(Direct To Home) company’s valuation target has fallen from its pre-pandemic valuation target of $3 Billion to $1 billion.
The DTH company is Tata Sons’ only consumer facing business in the media and entertainment industry. The report mentioned that Tata Play is India's largest DTH firm with 21 million subscribers.

The Tata Group company has informed the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) about the change in shareholding, the report said, citing a source privy to the matter.

Under the Ministry’s DTH rules, licence holders have to inform the ministry about changes in shareholding, partnerships and foreign direct investment patterns.

"Tata Sons has bought out Temasek's stake in Tata Play. The DTH company has intimated the MIB about the change in shareholding," a senior media executive told Economic Times.
