His sculptures are crafted from sustainable, marine-grade cement and serve as an artificial habitat for aquatic life while drawing tourists away form overstressed natrual-reef areas. <span style="font-style: italic;">"I incorporated as many references to climate change, habitat loss and pollution a I could; those are the defining issue of our area,"</span> Taylor told CNN Travel. </p>
